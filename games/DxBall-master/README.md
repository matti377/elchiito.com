A HTML5 2D Game using canvas and Javascript.

Open game.html in any modern browser supporting HTML `<canvas>` element. 

Open chrome/chromium with the option `--allow-file-access-from-files`

Tested in Chrome 29.0.1547.57 and Chromium 28.0.1500.71.

If you are interested in understanding the code, read the file named
`GameArchitecture.txt` in the `docs\` folder. 

NOTE : 
The game resolution is fixed at 640 * 480 right now and FPS at 60.
The code lacks documentation and is littered with global variables.
