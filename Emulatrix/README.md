## MAME 2003 Plus notes:

- Playing Killer Instinct: Create a zip file named ```kinst-chd.zip``` that must contain ```kinst.zip``` and ```kinst.chd```. Emulatrix will unzip those files in order to run the game (takes several seconds).
- Saving and loading states: In some games (Killer Instinct, Mortal Kombat 1, 2 and Ultimate) the saving function doesn't work (core issue).

## Final Burn Alpha 2012 note:

- Playing Samurai Shodown III: You must use the ```samsho3h.zip``` file.

## Emulatrix has mobile compatibility (Android only)
