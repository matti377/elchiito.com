# Norman The Necromancer
This was a submission for JS13K 2022. It's not under active development. There's a retrospective on the project [here](https://danthedev.com/norman-the-necromancer/) on my blog.

To get a development environment running:
- Install node
- Run `npm install` in the project directory
- Run `npm run dev` to run locally

If you want to deploy a version of the game:
- Run `npm build` to create a build
- Now deploy the contents of the `dist` dir to a static site host (e.g. Netlify/GitHub pages).
